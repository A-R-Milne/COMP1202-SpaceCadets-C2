## Challenge 3 Extensions

- Added comments
- Added simple operators (+,-,*,/)
- Added if/else statements
- Added variable assignment, both of a constant and of the value of another variable.

## Assumptions
 
- Code is in a .txt file, and the ".txt" is not included when file name is input.
- Every line contains code, and all code only takes up one line.
- Variable names provided are valid strings.
- All variables are integers or floats.
- All commands are in lowercase.
- Comments start with "#".
- Simple operators are formatted as "[operator] variableA, variableB, variableOut;", where variableA and variableB are inputs, and variableOut is the one that the result is assigned to.
- If and if/else statements end with "end".
- When a command has multiple variables, those variables are comma-separated.
- If conditions are either >, < or =, and only one condition exists per if statement.
- If statements are formatted as "if variableA [condition] variableB;".
